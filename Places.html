			YES, as long as the LGU continues to require a negative RT-PCR test result to travel, 
			and as long as you follow more stringent measuresâ€”wearing double masks and not 
			removing them when you are at the airport and being more discerning with your choice of airline.</p>

			the hip vibe of the overall setting.</p>
